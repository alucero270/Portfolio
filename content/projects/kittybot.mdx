## Overview
KittyBot is a companion robot project focused on system integration: compute node + sensors + actuator control + a repeatable software stack. The intention is to develop robotics-adjacent skills (interfaces, control surfaces, reliability, and operational workflows).

## Why it matters
Robotics roles reward engineers who can ship across boundaries: software, hardware interfaces, debugging, and repeatable system behavior. KittyBot is built to make those skills visible.

## Architecture (target)
- High-level compute (Linux) for orchestration and behavior
- A microcontroller layer for deterministic servo/actuator control (timing-sensitive)
- Clear IPC boundary: telemetry + command messages
- Reproducible dev environment using containers

## Tech
- Linux, containers, structured services
- MCU integration (planned): STM32/Arduino-class controller (as appropriate)
- Sensor/actuator integration patterns, validation-first bring-up

## Current status
- Phase 1 planning + repo scaffolding; architecture and interface contracts being defined

## Next steps
- Define actuator/sensor MVP set
- Bring-up and validate control loop timing and safety constraints
- Add "sim mode" for behavior development without hardware
