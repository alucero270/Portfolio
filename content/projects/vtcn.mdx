## Overview
VTCN is a production-style embedded Linux platform project built on a BeagleBone Black. The goal is to gain demonstrable experience with embedded Linux workflows: hardware interface validation, cross-compilation, service reliability, and system debugging.

## Why it matters
This is my "embedded proof-of-work" project: GPIO/I2C/SPI/UART + daemon/service design + testable interfaces + documentation.

## Architecture (initial)
- User-space service (C/C++) that reads sensors and emits framed telemetry (CRC, timestamps)
- Local persistence (SQLite) for buffered offline operation
- Network transport (TCP/UDP) to a collector
- Bring-up + validation checklists per interface

## Tech
- BeagleBone Black (ARM Cortex-A8)
- C/C++, Linux tooling, systemd
- SQLite, sockets, structured logging

## Current status
- Phase 1 platform foundation and repo structure in progress

## Next steps
- Hardware bring-up checklist (GPIO + I2C)
- First end-to-end frame generator + loopback tests
- Add a simulator mode to develop without hardware
