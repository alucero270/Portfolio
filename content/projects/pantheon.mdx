## Overview
Pantheon is my ongoing homelab infrastructure project designed to simulate production-style environments: separate compute/storage domains, controlled changes, and documented operations.

## Why it matters
This is where I practice real systems habits: fault isolation, repeatable updates, monitoring, and reliable service operations.

## What I built
- Linux-based multi-node architecture separating compute, storage, and network domains
- Dockerized services with repeatable configuration and controlled updates
- Monitoring/logging/observability and validation under load

## Tech
- Linux, Docker
- Network segmentation concepts and service operations
- CI-style workflows for repeatability

## Current status
- Actively evolving as I add more AI/dev tooling and operational discipline

## Next steps
- Publish architecture diagram(s)
- Add "runbooks" and incident-style troubleshooting notes

## Evidence
- Repo: https://github.com/alucero270/pantheon
- Diagrams/screens: TODO
