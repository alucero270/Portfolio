## Overview
A hands-on systems integration project adapting a mechanically injected OM606 diesel engine into a modern vehicle platform, requiring signal emulation/validation to interface with factory ECUs and transmission controllers.

## Why it matters
It's real-world embedded-style debugging: timing, fault states, signal integrity, and iterative validation with live feedback.

## What I did
- Reverse-engineered and emulated sensor signals (crank, cam, throttle position) to interface with factory ECUs/controllers
- Iteratively validated signals using live system feedback to eliminate fault conditions and stabilize ECU/trans behavior under real-time constraints
- Documented system architecture, signal flows, and validation steps for repeatability

## Architecture notes (high level)
- Sensors/signals as contracts
- Validation loops: change -> test -> observe -> refine
- Fault-state driven debugging

## Current status
- Ongoing; the approach continues to evolve as I refine the long-term controller strategy

## Next steps
- Publish a clear signal map diagram
- Add a bench-test emulator mode and test plan
