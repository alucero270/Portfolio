## Overview
Codex is a personal knowledge-search and engineering assistant system designed to index and retrieve my project documentation, procedures, and decisions quickly and reliably.

## Why it matters
As projects scale, success depends on documentation quality and retrieval speed. Codex is my attempt to treat personal engineering documentation like a real org would: structured, searchable, and maintained.

## Architecture (target)
- Document ingestion (markdown + repo content)
- Search (FTS / vector as needed)
- Query interface that supports "engineering workflows" (procedures, ADRs, decisions)
- Integration with local AI tooling for guided assistance

## Tech
- Linux + Docker
- C#/.Net/React
- Search layer (FTS / vector; implementation evolves)
- Strong docs-first repo practices (templates, ADRs, procedures)

## Current status
- Iterating on system prompts, retrieval flow, and service structure

## Next steps
- Establish stable ingestion + retrieval MVP
- Add regression tests for retrieval quality ("known question -> expected docs")
- Publish a "How I use Codex" workflow guide on the site
