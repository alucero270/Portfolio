I'm Alex Lucero - a software engineer focused on building reliable, maintainable systems across application, infrastructure, and hardware-adjacent domains.

Professionally, I've delivered production software in .NET/C#, with supporting work in Python and JavaScript, and I'm increasingly focused on embedded Linux, robotics, and automotive-style systems integration. I care about correctness, observability, traceability, and documentation - the stuff that makes systems survivable long-term.

Outside of work, I build hands-on projects that force me across boundaries: embedded platforms, vehicle telemetry and signal validation, homelab infrastructure, and robotics experimentation.
